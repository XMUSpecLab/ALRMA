# CLRMA and ALRMA

Algorithms for signal extraction of hyperspectral Raman imaging data, including ALRMA and CLRMA.  

The demo.m script demonstrates a comparison of ALRMA and CLRMA over the hyperspectral Raman imaging of a HeLa cell sample.   

The related data can be downloaded in the 'master' branch of this project, which are '.mat' version for the convenience of implementation in Matlab.  

All the '.m'  and '.mat' files should be included in the same folder when you run the 'demo.m' script.
